HexBox supports the creation of hexahedral meshes that are outside of the scope of previous fully interactive modeling approaches working in polycube space, either because they contain internal singularities, or because fitting cuboids in the user interface is problematic due to the presence of non axis-aligned topological features or twisting.

HexBox allows users to model a wide range of mesh topologies, regardless of the number of handles and inner cavities. 
The Tic-tac-toe model has genus 5. The Hollow-sphere model has one cavity.

Modeling a hexmesh with multiple connected components starting from a single cube is possible with HexBox. 
The desired effect can be obtained by using hex removal to separate the various components.

Starting from a plain wheel, we modeled a single dent in HexBox and then copy/pasted it to insert all the others. 
The whole process took 2:42 min. Making the same model (Cogwheel1) creating each dent separately took 4:15 min.

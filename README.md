# HexBox: Interactive Box Modeling of Hexahedral Meshes

<p align="center"><img src="teaser.png"></p>

HexBox is an intuitive modeling method and interactive tool for creating and editing hexahedral meshes.
Hexbox brings the major and widely validated surface modeling paradigm of surface box modeling into the world of hex meshing.
